🔍 Task 1: Twitter Emoji Prediction 🔍

I’m excited to share the completion of a project during my internship at Cognorise Infotech. The goal was to predict emojis for tweets using machine learning.

🎯 Objective: Develop an accurate emoji prediction model for tweets.

📊 Approach:

    Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed tweet data.
    Feature Extraction: Used CountVectorizer and TFD vectorizer.
    Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression (TFD vectorizer, 32% accuracy), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

💡 Outcome:

    Naive Bayes Classifier achieved the highest accuracy.
    Gained valuable insights into text classification and model evaluation.

🔍 Task 2: Spam Email Detection 🔍
In this task, I explored various machine learning algorithms to detect spam emails effectively. I implemented:

🔹 Random Forest
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
🔹 Logistic Regression

Each model provided unique insights and performance metrics, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of email spam detection. This experience enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

🚀 Impact: Enhanced my machine learning skills and understanding of different algorithms.

🔍 Task 3: Movie Sendiment Analysis 🔍
For this task, I focused on analyzing movie reviews to determine sentiment using several powerful machine learning models:

🔹 Naive Bayes
🔹 XGBClassifier
🔹 Decision Tree

This project allowed me to dive deep into text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model comparison, enhancing my ability to tackle sentiment analysis challenges.
