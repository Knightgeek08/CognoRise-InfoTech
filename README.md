🔍 Task 1: Twitter Emoji Prediction 🔍

I’m excited to share the completion of a project during my internship at Cognorise Infotech. The goal was to predict emojis for tweets using machine learning.

🎯 Objective: Develop an accurate emoji prediction model for tweets.

📊 Approach:

    Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed tweet data.
    Feature Extraction: Used CountVectorizer and TFD vectorizer.
    Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression (TFD vectorizer, 32% accuracy), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

💡 Outcome:

    Naive Bayes Classifier achieved the highest accuracy.
    Gained valuable insights into text classification and model evaluation.

🚀 Impact: Enhanced my machine learning skills and understanding of different algorithms.



Thank you, Cognorise Infotech, for the support!
